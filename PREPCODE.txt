METHOD: growth:
	Base Growth Formula:
Growth=(hype+assets+products+reliability)×company type modifier×random variation
Growth=(hype+assets+products+reliability)×company type modifier×random variation

   	/* Hype, assets, products, and reliability are variables you've already defined for the company.
    	company type modifier introduces the strengths/weaknesses of each type. Random variation adds unpredictability.
	*/
	Modifiers Based on Company Type:

	    Vehicular:
	        Suffer in hype due to environmental issues, so their growth would be reduced based on that factor.
	    Growth multiplier=0.9×random(0.8, 1.2)
	    Growth multiplier=0.9×random(0.8, 1.2)
	    Ecommerce:
	        Suffer in assets, so they may have higher growth potential but with fluctuations.
	    Growth multiplier=1.1×random(0.6, 1.4)
	    Growth multiplier=1.1×random(0.6, 1.4)
	    Retail:
	        Suffer in reliability, meaning their growth would have sudden drops or be more volatile.
	    Growth multiplier=0.95×random(0.7, 1.5)
	    Growth multiplier=0.95×random(0.7, 1.5)
	    Consulting:
	        Suffer in products, but with higher reliability and lower growth potential.
	    Growth multiplier=1.05×random(0.9, 1.3)
	    Growth multiplier=1.05×random(0.9, 1.3)
	    Industry:
	        Suffer in hype but have stable assets and products, leading to more gradual growth.
	    Growth multiplier=0.85×random(0.8, 1.1)
	    Growth multiplier=0.85×random(0.8, 1.1)
